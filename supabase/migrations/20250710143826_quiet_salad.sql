  # Fix RLS policies to use profiles table

  1. Policy Updates
    - Drop all existing policies that reference users table
    - Create new policies using profiles table for role checking
    - Ensure proper access control for all tables

  2. Security
    - Maintain RLS on all tables
    - Update policies to use profiles.role instead of users.raw_user_meta_data
    - Preserve existing access patterns
