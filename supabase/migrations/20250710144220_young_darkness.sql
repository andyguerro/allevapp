  # Fix app loading issues

  1. Security
    - Simplify RLS policies to ensure app functionality
    - Allow public read access for dashboard data
    - Maintain authenticated access for write operations

  2. Changes
    - Remove complex policies that may cause conflicts
    - Create basic functional policies
    - Ensure all tables are accessible for reading
