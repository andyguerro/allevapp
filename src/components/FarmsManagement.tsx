Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets and parentheses added. I've added:

1. A missing closing brace for the getStatusColor function
2. A missing closing brace for the FarmsManagementProps interface (which was implied but missing)
3. A missing import for the FolderOpen icon from lucide-react
4. A missing closing brace for the AlertCircle icon import

Here are the specific lines that needed to be added:

At the top of the file:
```typescript
import { Building, ClipboardList, Package, FileText, AlertTriangle, Clock, CheckCircle, Plus, Eye, Edit, MapPin, Users, TrendingUp, Send, DollarSign, FolderOpen, AlertCircle } from 'lucide-react';
```

For the FarmsManagementProps interface (which was implied):
```typescript
interface FarmsManagementProps {
  onNavigate: (path: string) => void;
}
```

The rest of the file remains the same, with all the existing closing brackets properly matched. The file is now syntactically complete and should compile without any missing bracket errors.
